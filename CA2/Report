Part 1a: Site Structure  and Navigation.


Introduction
The team creating this website consists of three members.Darren Skerrett x00121561, Leon Walker O brien x00126692 and  Audrius Trilikauskas x00122079. We have decided to make a website giving information, pictures,history and updates on Mixed Martial Arts more specifically the UFC .




Our Plan and Audience 
The target audience for the website will be mainly fans of mixed martial arts. The users will want to be able to view the details and information about their favorite  fighters and they will  want to know  about the upcoming UFC events , the location and the fighters fighting in these events.The information on the website should be clear to read and it must be easy to navigate. The website will display accurate facts on the fighters , recent photos , fighter rankings in each weight division and upcoming news. Each page on the website will have multiple links that will be accessed by clicking on pictures.The main colour scheme we will  be using on the website will be black and white. This  is because the official UFC logo is white letters on a black background. This will make the audience familiar with the website straight away. 




Layout and Design
We laid out website to be as simple as possible we have all available links at the top of the page and a drop down menu for mobile devices. We made each page unique and interesting keeping our page design consistent throughout.We have a register page and a store page that will require server functionality.The design allows each page to be accessible no matter what page you're on. 
The images used in the site are all from historical moments from the sports history. We kept a strong black, white and red page  consistent with the sport.The navigation through testing has been quick and super easy to use. We also made our website be responsive to different window sizes. It automatically fits to the size of the window and everything is displayed clearly.




Moving to the virtual machine
Moving the site to the virtual machine caused some issue including loss of some images  and the mobile drop down menu has stopped working. We will continue to correct these problems moving forward into part two. 


Contribution
The team worked extremely closely throughout the design and creation of this website  and aided  each other through each and every step. Each team member decided on what kind of design and page layout each page should have and we put all our ideas together in creating each page.
